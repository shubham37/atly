# Web Scraping Tool Design and Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation of a Python-based web scraping tool using FastAPI. The tool scrapes product data from a target website and saves it in a structured format. It also incorporates features such as authentication, retry mechanisms, in-memory caching, and notification systems. The design adheres to best practices for object-oriented programming (OOP) and scalability.

---

## Objectives

1. **Scraping**: Extract product data (title, price, and image) from the target website.
2. **Storage**: Save scraped data locally in a JSON file with flexibility to switch storage mechanisms.
3. **Notifications**: Notify about the scraping process with details of updates.
4. **Authentication**: Secure the API endpoint with token-based authentication.
5. **Caching**: Avoid redundant updates for unchanged product data.
6. **Retries**: Retry failed requests with a configurable delay.

---

## Features

### 1. **Scraper Settings**

Settings can be configured dynamically via query parameters:

- `max_pages`: Limit the number of pages to scrape.
- `proxy`: Use a proxy for requests.

### 2. **Storage Abstraction**

A storage handler interface allows flexibility in storage strategies. The default implementation uses local JSON files, but other mechanisms (e.g., databases) can be added easily.

### 3. **Notifications**

The tool provides scraping statistics, including the number of products scraped and updated. The default notification mechanism is console logging, but this can be extended (e.g., email, messaging services).

### 4. **Caching**

An in-memory cache prevents redundant updates for products whose prices have not changed, improving efficiency.

### 5. **Retry Mechanism**

Failed requests are retried up to three times with a delay of 5 seconds between attempts, handling transient network issues.

### 6. **Authentication**

The endpoint is protected with a static token, ensuring only authorized users can initiate scraping.

## Design Components

### 1. **FastAPI Endpoint**

The `/scrape` endpoint:

- Accepts query parameters for `max_pages` and `proxy`.
- Requires an authentication token.
- Uses dependency injection for settings and authentication.

### 2. **Scraper Class**

Handles the core logic:

- Fetches and parses HTML pages.
- Extracts product data.
- Saves images locally.
- Updates the cache and database if necessary.

### 3. **StorageHandler Interface**

Defines a common interface for saving scraped data. The default implementation is JSON file storage.

### 4. **Notification System**

Implemented as a simple console logger. The interface can be extended for alternative strategies (e.g., email).

## Code Efficiency and Scalability

- **Efficiency**:
  - Cached data reduces redundant writes.
  - Retry mechanism avoids unnecessary failures.
- **Scalability**:
  - Modular design allows easy extension (e.g., additional storage backends or notification strategies).
  - OOP principles ensure maintainability.

---

## Future Improvements

1. **Database Integration**: Replace JSON storage with a relational or NoSQL database for scalability.
2. **Distributed Scraping**: Use tools like Celery for distributed task execution.
3. **Advanced Caching**: Implement persistent caching using Redis or similar technologies.
4. **Enhanced Notifications**: Integrate email or Slack notifications for status updates.
5. **Improved Authentication**: Replace static token with OAuth2 or API key-based authentication.

---

## Testing

- Unit tests for scraper logic, storage handlers, and caching.
- Integration tests for the `/scrape` endpoint.
- Mocking external HTTP requests for testing retry logic.

---

## Conclusion

The tool is designed to efficiently scrape product data with flexibility in storage and notification mechanisms. It adheres to modern software design principles, making it robust and extensible for future requirements.
